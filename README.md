```py
# ==================== #
## PRINT TEXT
# print text! (all of the below prints out "hello")
print("hello")

a="hello"
print(a)

# ==================== #



# ==================== #
## LOOPS
# prints 0,1,2
for i in range(0,3):
   print(i)

# same, but all in one line
for i in range(0,3): print(i)


## range
# basically just defines a 'range',
#  and the "arguments" (the input-dots of range(...)) is basically the START and END.

# for i in range(0,10): print(i)
# prints out 0 to 9
##   (why not 0 to 10? cuz in computing terms 0 is a number,
##    so "0 is one", "1 is two"(because we 'started' at 0)

##  this is also called 'zero index based' where 0 is actually
##  seen as "1" (a bit difficult to explain but, 0,1,2   is  "equivalent"
##    or "the same"  as   1,2,3) <- generally speaking
